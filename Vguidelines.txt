Filipe creators contest: Valentines day
2/7/2020
Guidlines and rules CST

	Valentines day-- many historians believe that the saint who this holiday is named after was executed on February fourteenth-- why we celebrate it then. But enough about that-- lets talk about the contest.

	We want everyone to have fun with our Filipes, weather it be cards, images, or competitions. With this competition, the Valentines competion, we must establish rules, just like with all competitions. While they may be slightly limiting, it's the only way to ensure a safe, secure environment to show off our Filipes around.
<I would put a "Safe Filipe" right here, but this is a .txt format, soooo...... use your imagination.>

	Now, here are the guidelines:
		-All images must be original. No tracing. While you can highly, clearly reference outside sources, you cannot trace or copy from other images.
		-No image may insult a person or group of people in any way, shape, or form.
		-All images must have a relationship with Valentines day or something highly simillar.
		-All images must use the Filipe image as a base.
		-Images must be submitted by February 14, 7:00 AM CST time zone, year 2020 C.E.
		-All images should be turned in with a GAVOCA37.ORG EMAIL.
	
	Failure to follow these rules may result in expulsion from this contest only, or sometimes many or all future contests, depending on the severity of the defiance. That is all. Have fun drawing Filipes!
